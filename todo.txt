start writing transformation functions 

build out and test “controller response” framework 

clean up supercollider to use a Channel class


SHOULD DO (but seem to work for now):
test more thoroughly if rendering is correct over nodes' state changes

think through functor implementation once more



integrating "sequence micro-lang" for arranging Pydal patterns:
have a pydal function 
	arrange(string, [patterns...])
		string - the "sequence" string with only symbols lowercase a-z
		patterns - the patterns to be arranged
the first pattern is denoted by "a", 2nd by "b" and so on.
the function will validate whether you're using improper symbol names
this removes the need to pass in a symbol->pattern mapping 
like any pydal function, it will produce a single long timeseries on render()
it will re-render all of its child patterns when render() is called on it
watch out for handling the rest "~" symbol 
	- strip it out when post-processing the "sequencing lang" symbolic output?
